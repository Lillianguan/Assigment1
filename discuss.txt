About the accuracy >

1. the gravitation: influces the distance between the disks. especcially for the very first one.
2. Firction: between backbones with disks.
3. intersction: geometric structure. (external force)
   e.g. :
   our modeling compute the distance separatly.
   for the roboter: the tendons of the segment 2 go through the first segment, 
   which cause the deformation of the first segment.At the same time, segment 1 also has the influce of the first.
4. in fact, the tendons between of the disks is actaully straight.to minimum the error, we could reduce the distance
   between disks.
5. acccording to the elasticity of the tendons, they could be stretch.
 
6. betweenfirstandsecondarybackbones
